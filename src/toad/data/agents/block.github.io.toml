# Goose 🪿

**An open source, extensible AI agent**

Goose is an open framework for AI agents that goes beyond code suggestions to install dependencies, execute commands, edit files, and run tests.

## Key Features

- **Extensible Framework**: Plugin-based architecture for custom tools and behaviors
- **Multi-LLM Support**: Works with various LLM providers
- **Agent Client Protocol (ACP)**: Native ACP support for editor integration
- **Multiple Interfaces**: CLI, and ACP server modes

## ACP Integration

Goose works seamlessly with ACP-compatible editors including:
- Zed
- Neovim
- Marimo
- Any other ACP-enabled development environment

To run Goose as an ACP agent: `goose acp`

This command is automatically invoked by ACP-compatible clients and typically not run directly by users.

## Configuration

You can override ACP configurations using environment variables:
- `GOOSE_PROVIDER`: Set your preferred LLM provider
- `GOOSE_MODEL`: Specify the model to use
