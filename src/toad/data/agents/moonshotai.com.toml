# Kimi CLI

**Your next command-line AI agent from Moonshot AI**

Kimi CLI is a command-line agent tool that supports Agent Client Protocol out of the box and can help with software development tasks and terminal operations.

## Key Features

- **Agent Client Protocol (ACP)**: Native ACP support for editor integration
- **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**: Supports MCP config convention for external system integration
- **Zsh Integration**: Dedicated plugin for Oh My Zsh users
- **Multi-Platform**: Supports macOS and Linux (Windows coming soon)

## ACP Integration

Use Kimi CLI with any ACP-compatible editor or IDE. For Zed, add to ~/.config/zed/settings.json:

```json
{
  "agent_servers": {
    "Kimi": {
      "command": "kimi",
      "args": ["--acp"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Zsh Plugin

For Zsh users, install the plugin:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/MoonshotAI/zsh-kimi-cli.git \\
  ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/kimi-cli
```

Add `kimi-cli` to your plugins in ~/.zshrc, then press Ctrl-X to enter agent mode.

## Installation

It's highly recommended to install with uv (requires Python 3.13):
```bash
uv tool install --python 3.13 kimi-cli
```

Run `kimi --help` to verify installation.
